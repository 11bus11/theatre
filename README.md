# Theatre booking website
A website for a made up theatre, with booking functions. This website was made as the fourth project of the Code Institute's diploma in software development.

## UX - User Experience
### User Stories
I want the costumer to be able to:
- See what dates the plays are.
- Make bookings, reebook and cancel bookings.
- See their booking information.

I want the admin to be able to:
- See the bookings made.
- Change and cancel bookings.

### Colour
I chose to use red bacause it is a common colour used in theatres. I have a lighter and a darker red for background and menues. Then i have a green for buttons, and black and white for the text. White is also used for the content fields.

All colours passed the [Accessibility Checker's](https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/color-contrast-checker/) colour contrast test.
