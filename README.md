# Theatre booking website
A website for a made up theatre, with booking functions. This website was made as the fourth project of the Code Institute's diploma in software development.

## UX - User Experience
### User Stories
I want the costumer to be able to:
- See what dates the plays are.
- Make bookings, reebook and cancel bookings.
- See their booking information.

I want the admin to be able to:
- See the bookings made.
- Change and cancel bookings.

### Colour
I chose to use red bacause it is a common colour used in theatres. I have a lighter and a darker red for background and menues. Then i have a green for buttons, and black and white for the text. White is also used for the content fields.

All colours passed the [Accessibility Checker's](https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/color-contrast-checker/) colour contrast test.

### Structure and typography
I wanted the website to look classy and to remind people of a theatre (tried to do that with the background colour).
#### Structure

#### Typography
All fonts are san serif due to it being easier to read on a screen. The fonts i chose were Mukta for the content, and Pinyon Script for "city theatre" at the top. It is also used for some of the text ont he log in page and the promotional image.
